# Running ETAS simulations in parallel on HPC resources

This instructions assume that you have access to a linux cluster running the [Slurm workload manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) and have installed, configured, and tested either MPJ Express or FastMPJ. These have already been configured at [USC HPC](https://hpcc.usc.edu/) and [TACC Stampede2](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2).
